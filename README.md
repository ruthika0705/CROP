# DataStics
This is a walkthrough for our final year project where we have built a website for Recommending crops to the farmers using Machine Learning 

You can access it at [Website](https://datastics.herokuapp.com/)

Note: The website may take a minute to load sometimes, as the server may be in hibernate state

 Feel free to contact me and I will get back to you as soon as possible! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramesh-bhutka-71a632157/)
